# What is Trustify?

Trustify is a tool that helps you understand the security of your software. It
acts as a central hub for all your Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and
security advisories. By collecting and analyzing this data, Trustify gives you a
clear picture of the components in your software and any known vulnerabilities
they might have.

## How Trustify Helps

In today's complex software world, keeping track of every component and its
security status is a major challenge. Trustify is designed to make this easier
by:

- **Centralizing Your SBOMs**: Store and search all your CycloneDX and SPDX
  SBOMs in one place.
- **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: Automatically cross-reference your software
  components against public security advisories to find threats.
- **Meeting Compliance**: Easily check if SBOMs meet regulatory requirements
  (e.g. using correct licenses).
- **Analyzing Without Installing**: Understand the security of your applications
  without needing to download or run them.

## Who is Trustify For?

Trustify is for anyone involved in building, deploying, or securing software,
including:

- **Developers**: Quickly check for vulnerabilities in the components you use
  every day.
- **Security Engineers**: Get a comprehensive view of the security posture of
  all your applications.
- **Compliance Officers**: Ensure that your organization is meeting its software
  supply chain security obligations.
