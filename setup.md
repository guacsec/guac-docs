# Start a demo GUAC with Docker Compose

{: .note }

If you’d prefer, you can set up GUAC with Kubernetes with the experimental
[Helm charts provided by Kusari](https://github.com/kusaridev/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/guac).
Note that these helm charts are still experimental and are hosted in a
third-party repo and may not be synchronized with the GUAC repo.

This tutorial will walk you through how to deploy a demo-level GUAC, using
Docker Compose, so that you get just enough components to complete all the [GUAC demos]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guac-use-cases.md %}).

To get started, [install and start GUAC]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link setup-install.md %}).
