# Set up the GUAC Visualizer

The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph, as
well as a means to explore the supply chain and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visualizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems.

## Requirements

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A fresh copy of the [GUAC service infrastructure through Docker
  Compose]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link setup.md %})

## Step 1: Clone the GUAC visualizer repo

1. We highly suggest cloning the GUAC visualizer repo in the same path as you
   cloned the main GUAC repo:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:guacsec/guac-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Change directories into the repo:

   ```bash
   cd guac-visualizer
   ```

All commands run throughout this guide should be in this working directory.

## Step 2: Initialize the guac-visualizer from source

1. Install the guac-visualizer dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   The output should look like:

   ```
   $ yarn install
   yarn install v1.22.19
   warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid   resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.

## Step 3: Configuring the GraphQL endpoint

The application retrieves the GraphQL endpoint from the environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_DESTINATION. You should set this variable before running the application. By default, if this variable is not set, it assumes that the GraphQL server is run on http://localhost:8080/query.

1. To change the GraphQL endpoint you can set the NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_DESTINATION environment variable like this:

```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_DESTINATION=http://localhost:8080/query
```

Or, create a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory and set a value by adding a line in there like this:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_DESTINATION=http://localhost:8080/query
```

## Step 4: Accessing the server

1. You can then run the server (which will run by default on
   `http://localhost:3000`)

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. The ouput should look like:

```bash
$ npm run dev

> guac-visualizer@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
warn  - You have enabled experimental feature (appDir) in next.config.js.
warn  - Experimental features are not covered by semver, and may cause unexpected or broken application behavior. Use at your own risk.

info  - Thank you for testing `appDir` please leave your feedback at https://nextjs.link/app-feedback

event - compiled client and server successfully in 1867 ms (560 modules)
```

3. You can access the server easily through a web browser and navigating to
   http://localhost:3000. The page will look like the following:
