# GUAC use cases

The following are demos that show you the multitude of ways that you can use
GUAC. If you are following along and want to visualize the output from the
demos, you can [install the GUAC visualizer]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link
guac-visualizer.md %}). Additionally, you can [use the GraphQL API]({{
site.baseurl }}{%link guac-graphql.md %}) to build your own functionality on top
of GUAC.
